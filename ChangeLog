2014-11-13 Axel Pauli <kflog.cumulus@gmail.com>

  * Issue #36 Improve task editor list search.
    I added a search function, that make it easier to navigate fast to a certain
    waypoint list element, if its name is known. The found waypoint element can
    be taken over into the task list by pressing the return key, if the search
    input field has the keyboard focus.

  * Issue #35 Improve task editor help.
    I introduced a menubar with a help menu entry, connected to the shortcut F1.

  * Default map projection changed from Lambert to Cylinder projection.
  
  * If the home latitude is set or modified by the user and the cylinder map
    projection is active, the cylinder map projection standard parallel is set
    automatically to the home latitude value to ensure the best map projection.
    For the lambert map projection this is not realized due to more effort.

2014-08-07 Axel Pauli <kflog.cumulus@gmail.com>

  * KFLog 4.7.2 released for Debian and Ubuntu after move to GitHub

2014-06-01 Axel Pauli <kflog.cumulus@gmail.com>

  * Flight recorder data added to flight's objecttree.

  * Bugfix: Endless loop fixed in Welt2000 update procedure.
  
  * Waypoint class modified. All runway attributes are put into a Runway class 
    object and the single Runway objects into a runway list. Now a waypoint
    can have several runways.
    
  * Default constructor added to Waypoint class.
  
  * Default constructor added to Runway class.
    
  * WaypointCatalog class, methods read/write binary adapted to latest Cumulus
    release 5.5.2.

  * Bugfix: Waypoint file selection dialog did not contain *.da4 filter entry for
    all items.
    
  * Bugfix: Airspace violations must be calculated with the barometical altitude
    and not with the GPS altitude. Airspace contacts limited to violations, all
    other can become too much. Altitude info added to begin and end of airspace
    violation. Airspaces must not be loaded again, reuse already loaded airspaces
    from MapContent.
    
  * Airspace contact check execution time crucial reduced by using QPainterPath
    class. Airspace contacts are stored only once as list in the Flight object
    and not more in every FlightPoint object.

  * Build with Linux Ubuntu 13.04 and Qt4.8.4
  
  * Build with Linux Debian 7.1 and Qt4.8.2

2013-01-02 Matthias Degenkolb <matthias.degenkolb@googlemail.com>
  
  * added storing of QNH in extra settings file
  
  * added option to manually set QNH via flight menu

  * added airspace checking (partly backport from Cumulus)
  
  * airspaces shown in browser window
  
  * added airspace data view
  
  * Still open: QNH is currently hard-coded to 1013 hPa, therefore airspace checking is not fully precise...

2012-10-29 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * KFLog 4.6.2 released.

  * Additional checks added in OpenAir parser to prevent that wrong defined
    coordinates are taken over. That caused sometimes a crash.
    
  * Free disk space method fixed, it delivered wrong results.
  
  * Welt2000 update check added.
    
  * Build with Ubuntu 12.10 and Qt4.8.3

  * added terrain altitude in status bar

2011-12-22 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * Added rfcomm0 to the list of selectable devices in the recorder dialog.
    This is the standard bluetooth device on most Linux systems.

2011-11-23 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Modifications in waypoint tree view widget. A catalog import was only
    possible in KFLog format. I changed that to all supported waypoint formats.
    The menu item "Import from File" has been removed. The contained Volkslogger
    menu entry has been added to the "Open Catalog" and to the "Import Catalog"
    menu items. I hope that gives the user more fexibility in catalog handling.
  
2011-11-22 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Map and GUI icons added as resources to the KFLog binary. The Qt Resource
    system is used for that purpose.

2011-11-21 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * KFLog 4.6.0 released.

2011-11-16 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also can be handled
    runway length values using unit feet. That is not conform to the SeeYou
    specification but I saw that in a south African waypoint file.
    
  * Map item Highway renamed to Motorway according to OSM usage.

2011-10-22 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Export routine added to write SeeYou waypoint files with extension .cup.

2011-10-11 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

2011-10-03 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * New menu item added to map menu for asking of airspaces.
  
  * City labels are drawn now at the map till scale level less than 100. I saw
    at a first look that not all city labels are the right ones. The issue
    lays in the map data.

2011-10-02 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix: The coordinates of the map cursor were only displayed in the main
    window's statusbar, if a flight was loaded. That annoyed me. I fixed that.

2011-09-30 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix: If you touch a drawn flight line with the mouse the data of the
    touched flight point is displayed in the lower statusbar of the main window.
    The displayed coordinates were wrong. The latitude and longitude were
    skewed.
    
  * If the begin or end cursor is moved in the evaluation window, the related
    flight point is now displayed with all its data in the main window's
    statusbar. I want to get the coordinates for a certain position in the
    barogram of the evaluation window. 

2011-09-29 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * KFLog 4.4.0 released.

2011-09-29 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Two new spin boxes added to evaluation view for scaling of speed and
    variometer display by hand or automatically.

2011-09-28 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

    values. That ensures that all available place is used for the drawing.
    
2011-09-27 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Minimum scale for zooming in changed from 10 to 5.
  
  * Bugfix: Spelling bug fixed in configuration items /Scale/LowerLimit and
    /Scale/UpperLimit.
  
  * Bugfix: Maximum scale value for zoom out via mouse wheel was to large.
    That caused senseless map loading of the whole world.
    
  * IGC file name added to window title of evaluation view and to flight data
    window content.
   
2011-09-13 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

    could not be parsed successfully during read in.

2011-07-04 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * BUGFIX: Method writeFilserDA4 file crashes with a core dump, if waypoint
    number is greater than 600. Fixed now.
    
  * BUGFIX: Waypoint import failed for Seeyou cup data file, if elevation unit
    was given in feet. Fixed now.
    
  * BUGFIX: Problems fixed in coordinate editor. There was no longitude degree
    input possible for values between 80-99 degrees.

2011-06-28 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

2011-06-22 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Some more checks added to class WaypointCatalog to prevent core dumps
    during read of wrong file content.
    
  * kflog.desktop file updated and integrated into the package build.

2011-06-21 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * New method added to the WaypointCatalog class, which can read in waypoint
    data from a Welt2000 file. The amount of waypoints must be limited by
    country identifiers because the whole file contains over 57282 entries.
    
  * WaypointTreeView extended to read a Welt2000 file. Runways are listed with
    both directions now.

2011-06-19 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * KFLog 4.0.0 released.

2011-06-19 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * BUGFIX: Window menu item should only be enabled, if flights are loaded.
    Furthermore it was wrong conected, so that multiple times a flight was
    activated.
    
  * Plugins are no longer stored in bin directory. Created a new lib directory
    for them.

  * Added some stuff for a debian package build to automate that process and
    make a delivery easier.
    
2011-06-16 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * New check menu option added under view. A user can define, if he wants to
    to get displayed automatically the content of map items or not, which are
    touched by the mouse pointer.
    
  * Pressing control key and the left mouse button starts the drag zoom
    action now. Same can be initiated by pressing key zero before.
    
  * Pressing the left mouse button during mouse move will move the map in mouse
    direction. If the move pause is longer as 1s a redraw of the map is done.
    
  * Turning mouse wheel will zoom in/out map now.
  
2011-06-14 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * BUGFIX: Seeyou waypoint read in method did assign sometimes wrong map
    element types. 

2011-06-10 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Moving flag in flight animation replaced by a rotating glider symbol.
    That is the better solution. Thanks to Cumulus, from where I could copy it.
    
  * Bugfix: Integer validators in coordinate input boxes makes trouble on
    some values. Leading zeros were removed. I replaced them by
    QRegExpValidators.

2011-06-09 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix: Methods Map::slotCenterToTask() and Map::slotCenterToFlight() did
    not work right for flight groups.
    
  * Bugfix: If a flight group was selected, the data of a flight point were never
    displayed during mouse touch. Missing handling implemented.

2011-06-07 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix: Forgot to port to Qt4 the opengl_igc part. Fixed now.
  
  * Bugfix: Normal flight animation start, pause and stop is working now without
    QPainter complains. The other animate actions are not yet usable. Will be
    the next work to get it running.

2011-06-06 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix: FlightDataPrint had a corrupted output format. I fixed that.
  
  * Bugfix: TaskDataPrint had a corrupted output format. I fixed that.
  
  * Bugfix: It seems to be necessary to add the library option -ldl to the
    qmake project file. A link error was reported to me on 64 bit systems.

2011-06-01 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix: Lakes were never drawn at the map. There brush color was also
    not configurable. Both issues fixed.
    
  * Bugfix: Saving the map into an image did not work.

2011-05-31 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in class MapMatrix. Variable matrixSize was used but never
    initialized. Modified code in that way to use only variable mapViewSize.
    
  * Added degree labels to map grid.

2011-05-30 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Class MapPrint replaced by direct printing of the map content. It was the
    easiest method to get a good print picture. The old code did not work as
    expected and it was to much effort for me to get running it.

2011-05-27 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>
  
  * Dialog of class MapPrint ported to Qt4.
  
  * Whole Qt3 support removed from qmake project files. After a half year of hard
    work KFLog compiles now with Qt4 without using Qt3Support library. But
    not all parts do running under Qt4. Print management and flight animation
    need further work to get them running.

2011-05-26 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * A task name is stored and retrieved now from the XML file content.
  
  * Guicontrol directory removed. Class KFLogListView not more in use because
    it was not portable to Qt4. It was replaced by the new class KFLogTreeWidget.
    
  * Editor field home country added to personal configuration page.
  
  * Tried to get running the graphical flight planning. Old code was very
    complex, confusing and user unfriendly. I used a new approch. If a flight
    task is created, graphical planning is switched on. You see that on the
    string in the lower left corner of the status bar. There is displayed
    "Task planning on". If you click at the map by pressing the left mouse
    button, a menu is popup with the supported task actions. You can add,
    remove and create waypoints. But there are some constrains. Waypoints
    are only appended to the end of the task list. You can not change the order
    of waypoints and the waypoint move is also not supported. For modifying the
    flight task you should use the task editor. Important is to finish an opened
    graphical flight planning action. That is also supported by the task menu.
    
2011-05-24 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * The type of a waypoint is missused by a flight task to overwrite it with a
    task point type. Added a new variable tpType to the Waypoint class to solve
    this conflict.
    
   * TaskDialog fully ported to Qt4. But there were some unusual things
     programmed. The software should not do unexpected things by the user.
     The necessary checks, if the FAI requirements are fulfilled are done now,
     if the ok button is pressed. At the moment is not clear for me how the
     task management is supported by the map and the mouse.

2011-05-19 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Flight recorder plugins fully ported to Qt4. It seems that the Garmin
    and SoaringPilot plugins do not fulfill the KFLog plugin requirements.
    Therefore I disabled the copying of the related desktop files into the
    release area. The plugins must be tested, if they work right.

2011-05-18 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * RecorderDialog widget fully ported to Qt4. It was a hard pice of work :-((
    It must be tested the whole provided functionality. I have no logger devices
    to do that.
    
  * Recorder plugin Filser fully proted to Qt4.
  * Recorder plugin Cambrigde fully proted to Qt4.
  * Recorder plugin Volkslogger fully proted to Qt4.

2011-05-05 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in waypoint import from map. If map center was selected as center
    point it was never taken because the center reference value was never
    set in the waypoint catalog.
  * Bugfix in recorder dialog. The plugin definitions and libraries were
    searched at wrong places and never found. I adapted all to the current
    used release structure.

2011-05-01 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * XUbuntu 11.04 uses gcc version 4.5.2 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.5.2-8ubuntu4). That
    caused some compiler complains which I fixed. I hope that older compiler
    versions can handle the made modifications.

2011-04-07 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Support for task declaration in Cambridge 302 vario/logger.

2011-04-04 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in waypoint catalog class. An outlanding in the readCup method
    was never set as landable. I fixed that.

2011-03-18 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Fixed some bugs that caused KFLog to crash
  * Communication with loggers works again

2011-03-16 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Qt Version check added to global makefile and qmake project file.
    That shall prevent the build with wrong Qt versions.

2011-03-15 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Country handling added to waypoints and airfields. Changed some types
    of variables.
  * Binary waypoint file format adapted to latest Cumulus version.
  * XML waypoint file format extended by some new items. Cumulus supports
    too the XML waypoint file format now.

2011-03-10 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Names of waypoints limited to 8 characters and to upper cases.
  * Runway headings limited to range 10...36. 0 stands for unknown heading.
  * Waypoint dialog adapted to the new requirements.
  * Waypoint catalog's read/write methods adapted to the new needs.

2011-03-03 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Different not more needed debug messages removed.

2011-03-02 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Error fixed in menu point available flights. Caused a core dump.
  * An optimized flight was never redrawn in the EvaluationDialog class.
    Missing call added in MainWindow. Labels of optimized flights can overwrite
    each other if the lay to near together in EvaluationDialog. 
  * Zooming rectangle was never drawn at the map. That is fixed now. It was a
    longer fight to get it running.
  * Some QPainter complains fixed in class Map. But there are remain some
    more issues in animation of flights.

2011-03-01 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Class IgcPreview removed. Not more usable under Qt4 because the
    support was removed in Qt4.
  * Form ui_optimizationwizard removed. Was never used in the current
    binary but always built.
  * Class OLC OptimizationWizard ported to Ot4. The source code was a total
    chaos in my eyes. Could fix two core dumps but the whole thing needs
    some more tweaking. Will continue the work the next days.

2011-02-25 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * IGC 3D view widgets ported to Qt4. The size of the 3D flight should be
    better adapted to the real size of the widget at the first call.
    The help text of the IGC 3D view is forwarded to the help browser
    during the show event.
    
2011-02-24 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in flight statistic text in ElevationDialog class. Found two
    HTML format errors, which caused a wrong and not more readable
    display. Did some tweaking of the HTML formatting. Added a help
    text, which is displayed in the help browser during show event
    of ElevationDialog class.

2011-02-23 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * ElevationFinder class should not declare a parent in its constructor.
    That prevents complains by Glib during shutdown.
  * Flight elevation stuff ported to Qt4. It was a hard piece of work
    to redesign all drawing stuff that it fulfills the Qt4 requirements.
    One issue remains. If a flight is loaded and not all maps are available
    during load, the elevation profile of the diagram is incomplete.
    The format of the displayed flight text data needs some rework.

2011-02-21 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Thanks to valgrind, found a bug in ElevationFinder class. Class member
    useOGIE was not initialized. That cause a funny report by Qt, filename
    missing, during load of a flight.

2011-02-19 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * FlightSelectionDialog did never show loaded flights. I fixed that and ported
    the dialog fully to Ot4.
  * The close of a single flight in the object tree view has never considered
    an update of all flight groups. I fixed that.
  * Object menu tree expanded by a flight group item. Furthermore all child
    items are sorted by using column 0 only to get an better overview about all.
    
2011-02-18 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Tried to fix the flight cursor handling in class Map. Cursors were drawn
    at the widget's engine outside of the paint event. That caused warnings.
    Animated cursor handling has the same problem, must be fixed in the feature
    too.
  * Different bugs in data view format layout fixed.

2011-02-16 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Class HelpWindow fully ported to Qt4.
  * Masked painter removed from drawing of flights and tasks. But there remains
    complains by QPainter about wrong usage. I could not yet find out the real
    cause of that.
  * There is a design bug in the handling of flights and tasks. If a new flight
    or task was selected, the flight list index was updated but the current
    flight pointer never. That caused some funny side effects, not sure, if
    I could fix all. Another problem was the casting of the current flight
    variable to the derived class. The current flight was defined as
    BaseFlightElement and can contain three different derived classes. To find
    out, which class is contained, it must be used the dynamic cast operator.
    It delivers NULL, when the cast is wrong. But in most of the cases a
    static cast was used, which delivered always a pointer to something.
    If the wrong object was casted, a core dump was the result at the
    next access to that object.
  
2011-02-15 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Class FlightLoader fully ported to Qt4. The code of that class is a
    mixture of QSting methods and trival c functions. :-((
  * Class ObjectTree together with its list view items ported to Qt4.
    If the last opened flight was closed, a core dump occurred. It was caused
    by MapContents::closeFlight(), where a zero check was missing. I fixed
    that.
  * Bugfix in Optimization::setTimes method. Index out of range found, caused
    a core dump. I fixed that.

2011-02-13 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * File wp.h renamed to flightpoint.h. It contains a class FlightPoint and
    nothing with waypoint. Class Map fully ported to Qt4.
  
2011-02-12 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in class Waypoint Catalog. The waypoint name check message box
    did not allow an abort. I fixed that. Cup file read routine did not work
    properly. Strings could be enclosed in quotes and contain the comma
    separator. In such a case the separator must be ignored. I fixed that too.

2011-02-10 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Drawing of waypoint labels at the map reworked.
  * If a new waypoint is created at the map the elevation from the position
    is taken over into the waypoint dialog now.
  * Missing map icons for landmark added.

2011-02-09 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Class KFLogListView was replaced by the new class KFLogTreeWidget. This
    class saves too the tree view header and provides a menu by pressing middle
    mouse button for visibility toggling of columns of the tree view.
  * Waypoint catalog management was a bit confusion me. I hope that I could fix
    all detected problems by me.
  * An edited waypoint was inserted again in the current waypoint catalog. I
    blocked that now.
  * Class Waypoints was renamed to WaypointTreeView to get a better
    understanding what is managed here. Different issues fixed in that class.
    Delete, copy and move waypoint actions can handle now several waypoints
    at once.
  * The waypoint management should be ported now to Qt4. All import functions
    must be tested deeper, if they work correctly.
    
2011-02-04 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in class Waypoints. If no catalog is defined and the mouse button
    is pressed in the waypoint list, a core dump occurred. Fixed that in
    method showWaypointMenu.
  * Bugfix in WaypointImpFilterDialog. If the dialog was modified by the user
    and left via the cancel button, the content was not more in line with the
    catalog settings. I fixed that.
  
2011-02-03 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in class WaypointCatalog. In method insertWaypoint was never done
    an insert of a new waypoint. The insert statement was placed inside the
    existing path. It cost me two hours to find out that, uff ;-).
    Class WaypointCatalog is fully ported to Qt4 now.
  * All menu items in class Waypoints ported to Qt4.

2011-02-02 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * All bitBlt method calls replaced by Qt4 drawPixmap calls in class Map. That
    improves the drawing performance too.
  * Dialog WaypointImpFilterDialog ported to Qt4.

2011-02-01 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * New configuration widget added which handles units for altitude,
    distances and positions.
  * Class content of class CoordEdit taken over from Cumulus. This class
    can handle 3 different position formats.
  * WaypointDialog class ported to Qt4.

2011-01-28 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Airspace default print colors modified.

2011-01-28 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * KFlogConfig class ported completely to Qt4. The classes ConfigDrawElement
    and ConfigPrintElement were united into one class with name ConfigMapElement.
    That makes all configuration handling and the maintenance easier. It was a
    hard work to port that all. The modified configuration handling needs some
    testing, if it works right.
    All needed brush icons are created now in the new class. Removed all old brush
    icons from the pics directory.

2011-01-20 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Animation of tool bar and dock widgets switched off. It caused a lot of
    resizing actions and blocked the whole GUI.
  * Wrong call connections in class KFLogConfig fixed. Scale and waypoint
    catalog configuration were not callable. Started with Qt4 porting of
    class KFLogConfig. A lot of stuff is to modify here.
  * Bugfix in class DownloadManager to prevent a download deadlock of wrong
    map files.
  * Class RowDelegate taken over from Cumulus.

2011-01-19 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Class TopoLegend ported to Qt4 together with bug fixing. Works now as
    expected.
  * Class MapControlView ported to Qt4.
  * AboutWidget class taken over from Cumulus. About information added to main
    window as extra slot. The content was taken from main.cpp. Maybe the about
    information is not complete. Should be check by the maintainers.

2011-01-18 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Map menu ported to Qt4.
  * Translation lists of different map objects moved from the MainWindow class
    into the corresponding classes.
  * Map object search methods in class Map extended to include the OutlangingList.

2011-01-17 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix in method MapConfig::loadPixmap(). 

2011-01-13 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Method Airfield::getInfoString() over worked. It displays now some
    more information about the related item.
  * Outlandings included in Map::__displayMapInfo() method.

2011-01-13 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * BUGFIX: Welt2000 has changed the identifier for gliderfields.
    Parser modified to the new identifier.
  * Airfields are drawn now with considering the landing direction.
    Solution was taken over from Cumulus.
  * All kind of air facilities are united in one class with the name
    Airfield.

2011-01-11 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * All menubar items ported to Qt4. That was a very stupid work ;-)

2011-01-07 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * All toolbar items ported to Qt4.

2010-12-24 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Changed the application data default directory from ~/.kflog to ~/KFLog.
  * Introduced a new method to get the default application data directory from
    one place in MainWindow class. That makes future changes easier.
  * Class KFLogLogo replaced by QSplashScreen.
  * Map tile management in class MapContents taken over from Cumulus.
  * New makefile with name Makefile.qmake introduced to build a kflog test
    target with all needed data items.

2010-12-22 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Map redraw optimized after download of missing files. The already loaded
    data are not more cleared and loaded again.
  * Two new methods indroduced for loading of map icons and application
    pixmaps. There is defined now only on one place the path to the icons
    and pixmaps. Changing all old calls was a big stupid task.
  * Colors and brushes of airspaces changed to be more in conformance with
    ICAO guidelines. That is an open point for the printing functionality.

2010-12-21 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Class WhatsThat caused core dumps after displaying airspace information.
    Code of class partly replaced by the Cumulus code.
  * Pixmap drawing mechanism partly redesigned.
  * Function printPos moved from mapcalc to WGSPoint class.
  * Map scale bar issues fixed.
  * A black list has been added to the download manager to avoid download
    dead locks.

2010-12-18 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * OpenAir class taken over from Cumulus. Airspaces are drawn now at the map
    but there is some redesign needed for the drawing management in general.
    It works very inefficiently. Different fixes made for Qt4 to overcome
    a lot of compiler complains. Airspaces are handled now in value list.

2010-12-16 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Q3 pointer lists for terrain and map elements replaced by Qt4 value
    lists. Isoline management taken over from Cumulus.

2010-12-15 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Content of class WGSPoint taken over from Cumulus. Definitions of WGSPoint
    In MapMatrix removed. Method degreeToNum moved from class MapContens to 
    class WGSPoint.

2010-12-14 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Modified install targets in all sub qmake files. $INSTALL_ROOT defines
    the root install path now.
  * Automatic map and Welt2000 file download added. The required classes were
    taken over from Cumulus. Thanks to it ;-)
  * Bugfix in MapContent class. Isoline drawing works again. Welt2000 parser
    unfortunately not yet.
  * Different Qt4 portage actions done.
  * Doxygen configuration files added to kflog subdirectory. Call
    doyxgen to generate the html help files.
  
2010-12-11 Axel Pauli <axel@kflog.org>

  * Global QSettings object must be initialized according to the requirements
    of Qt. The configuration file is located at: $HOME/.config/KFLog as kflog.conf.
  * Removed the prefix /KFLog from all setting items. That results in a better
    group structure in the stored file. Before all was saved under the single
    group KFLog.
  * Replaced all Qt3 QString latin1() method calls by Qt4 toLatin1().data()
    methods calls.
  * Added some core attribute settings in main.cpp.
  * Introduced a target.h file which contains the current build version.
  * Class KFLog derived from Q3MainWindow renamed to MainWindow to make more
    clear the start point and main center of KFLog.
  * Modified install targets in kflog.pro qmake file. The install root destination
    must be defined now by passing the variable $INSTALL_ROOT during the make call.

2010-10-05 Constantijn Neeteson <kflog@neeteson.net>

  * changed build automation to qmake. See INSTALL for installation instructions.

2010-10-05 Constantijn Neeteson <kflog@neeteson.net>

  * automatic map download disabled, waiting for Qt4 classes (see downloadlist.cpp
    and mapcontents.cpp)
  * the layout of the Recorder and KFLogConfig dialog has been changed
  * dockwidgets are now standard turned off in the mainwindow, because the layout is
    ugly. Hopefully it is solvable in Qt4. In the meantim they can be made visible
    by selecting them in the Settings menu.
  * The positions of the dockwidgets and toolbar are not stored when KFLog quits.
  * KAbout has been removed. The contents is still available in main.cpp.
    Qt doesn't have an about class, so this has to be written by ourselfs.
  * In some messageboxes there was a checkbox to disable the same message in the
    future. Also, some messageboxes of recorderdialog contained a small screen with
    detailed information about an error. QMessageBox doesn't support this and
    therefore it has been removed.
  * The shortcuts and toolbar cannot be edited anymore, because Qt lacks the
    widgets that KDE had.
  * all files are now stored in %HOME%/.kflog/, it is not possible in Qt to find a
    dir like /usr/share/apps/kflog. I did not change this in the makefiles, because
    the automake configuration doesn't work properly anymore on my pc. I suggest
    that we change to qmake for build automation.

2009-10-08 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Eliminated more KDE dependencies
  * Removed OLC declaration code -- that's much easier via their website now.
  * General directory cleanup

2009-07-19 Constantijn Neeteson <kflog@neeteson.net>

  * Converted several KDE calls to their QT counterparts

2009-07-14 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Acknowledge CGIAR as source of our terrain mapdata
  * Update version number to 2.2.0 -- this is a release!

2009-07-14 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * New URL for mapfiles. The new file format will be the default now.

2009-07-12 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Use same terrain colors as in Cumulus

2009-07-11 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Bugfix in mapmatrix.cpp: We never actually used the map projection
    settings for the standard parallels which the user defined, because
    we looked for the values in the wrong config file section and ended
    up using the defaults instead.
  * Basic support for the new terrain file format. We don't get
    depressions right, because we use the wrong plotting order for
    isolines. But at least KFLog can understand both the old and the
    new format. We'll have to fix this once support for the old format
    ceases.
  * Updated URLs in the Tips of the Day

2009-04-21 Constantijn Neeteson <kflog@neeteson.net>

  * Bugfix in mapcalc.cpp: the time is now always shown in UTC,
    regardless of the timezone
  * Bugfix in flight.cpp: the first and last flightstage are now
    shown in the evaluation dialog
  * GUI improvement in handling flightgroups

2009-03-22 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * <ctrl>-o actually opens a flight now.
  * Support for the new terrain and ground file format. The new files
    will have the elevation index stored in the "sort" field (which
    we didn't use previously).

2009-03-17 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * If KFLog was closed in another mode than map view (i.e. viewing
    the waypoint list or the evaluation window) it started downloading
    lots of map files after the next startup. This is fixed now.

2009-02-01 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Basic support for changing glider and pilot information in
    Cambridge 300 series flight recorders

2008-12-29 Constantijn Neeteson <kflog@neeteson.net>

  * Further improvements in circling detection and the calculation
    of the bearings
  * Gardown/Garmin files must now be opened instead of imported
  * Removed FlightGear filetype support
  * Updated Dutch language file

2008-11-25 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Bugfix for printing configuration of double railways

2008-11-24 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Improvement of the flight path display
    (patch by Constantijn Neeteson)

2008-07-08 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * A number of bugfixes in the openairparser

2008-07-04 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Major improvement to the circling detection for flight evaluation
    (patch by Constantijn Neeteson)

2008-06-21 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Support for WELT2000 airfield files. Old airfield files are not
    supported anymore.
  * Changed mapdata directory stucture
  * More cleanup, Cambridge 300 stuff, ...

2008-06-05 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Improved flight evaluation (patch by Constantijn Neeteson)
  * Improvements for Cambridge 300 series flight recorder support

2008-04-11 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Support for OpenAir airspace files. The old airspace format
    is not supported anymore.
  * Improvements for Cambridge 300 series flight recorder support
  * Repository cleanup

2008-04-01 Hendrik Hoeth <hoeth@linta.de>

  * Repository cleanup and bugfixes
  * Make kflog 64-bit aware
  * Basic support for Cambridge 300 series flight recorders

2005-01-01 Andr� Somers <andre@kflog.org>

  * Runway information: runways are now stored when read, and used when
    waypoints are imported from the map.

  * Unknown objects in the waypoint list, for which there is no translation
    no longer cause a crash.

  * Don't show frequency in the waypoint list if the frequency is < 1.

2005-04-03 Heiner Lamprecht <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Fixed a bug in map.cpp:  The tooltipinfo is now displayed at the
    currect position.

2005-04-02 Heiner Lamprecht <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Did some code-cleanups to reduce comiler warnings due to type casts.

2005-03-26 Florian Ehinger <florian@kflog.org>

  * Added support for landmarks.

2004-03-14 Heiner Lamprecht <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Changed the behavior of the startup process. Now the process
    is interrupted, if no mapdirectory is defined.

  * Made some minor changes to reduce compiler warnings.


2003-11-24 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * added automatic detection of transfer speed for filser devices.

  * added supported transfer speeds to capabilies for all recorders


2003-08-22 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * bugfix in dataview.cpp: prevent crash when MapContents::getFlight() returns NULL.

  * enabled up/download of task buffers to/from lx devices


2003-08-01 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * added up/download for waypoint data to/from Filser recorder


2003-07-26 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * added import/export for filser txt and da4 waypoint files


2003-07-12 Florian Ehinger <florian@kflog.org>

  * added status windows during downloads / uploads to the recorder
    (not perfect yet!)


2003-07-11 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * added edit/delete waypoints to the map context menu

  * suppressed the rename/overwrite warning if nothing has changed

  * don't start the context menu timer when in planning mode

2003-07-10 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * added the waypoint list to the mapinfo that is displayed when activated
    by context menu or by tooltip popup

  * Bugfix: if waypoints are deleted, this has immediat effect on the map display now.


2003-07-09 Heiner Lamprecht <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Fixed a bug in EvaluationFrame::slotScale(), which could crash KFLog,
    if no flight was loaded.


2003-07-09 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * Updated german translation


2003-06-24 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * backported architecture independant code for Filser plugin from kflogembedded


2003-07-07 Andr� Somers <andre@kflog.org>

  * Made it possible to rename a waypoint if a waypoint with the same name is allready
    in the catalog and you try to add a new one. This also fixes the weird situation that
    there was no functional difference between the No and the Cancel options and the fact
    that Yes, No, and Cancel were not appropriate button labels.


2003-07-05 Andr� Somers <andre@kflog.org>

  * Made the mapinfo boxes appear as popups (like tooltips) if you hold the mouse over an
    interesting object on the map. The mapinfo is also accessible through the new context
    menu.


2003-07-04 Andr� Somers <andre@kflog.org>

  * Added a contextmenu to the map

  * Added the KFLogBrowser that replaces the old Tasks list

  * Added a pointer to the evaluation dialog that indicates the position currently
    selected on the map. Also very nice in animations!

  * Fixed a small bug in the Evaluation dialog

  * Tasks are treated as normal documents now too, so they show up in the Recent Documents
    list and can be dragged & dropped into the map or the KFLogBrowser, just like you can
    with flights.


2003-06-12 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * Bugfix: coordinates during flight animation are shown correctly now in status bar


2003-06-04 Heiner Lamprecht <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Changed the fonts in the printout of the flightdata.

  * Repaired the map-printing.


2003-06-05 Eggert Ehmke <eggert@kflog.org>

  * improved Filser interface, tested with different versions of lx devices

  * fixed bug: last entry in flight list is not doubled anymore

  * added duration column in flight list

    is smaler as the current scale.


2001-12-09 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Reduced the number of pixmaps used for drawing. "allSites", "airports"
    and "glider" are drawn into the same pixmap now.

    the next time he starts KFLog.


2001-12-07 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added all airspace-types to kflogconfig.

  * Reactivated printing. By now, all elements are printed the same way as
    displayed on the screen. We should add a seperate way to configure the
    printing.


2001-12-06 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Added more airspaces to the config-dialog. The default-values
    for pens and brushes need to be fixed.


2001-12-04 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Changed the meaning of the configdata for cities. From now on,
    "Color [1234]" is used for the outline, not for filling. Filling
    is configured by "Brush Color [1234]". Therfore, we must look at the
    version of the configfile. Due to the way, cities are drawn, one can
    not set brushstyle or penstyle.

  * Changed the way, cities will be drawn into the map. Now a city
    is drawn only one time without having mistakes even when the city
    lies at the edge of a map-section.


2001-12-02 Heiner <heiner@kflog.org>

  * Extended configuration-dialog and added widgets for configure penstyle

  * Added recognition of point-validation. Now the validation-flag of the
    logger will be read. Non-valid points will be ignored in calculation
    distance and speed.

  * Fixed some bugs in parsing an igc-file. Now a negative height will be
    read without generating an syntax-error.


2001-11-18 G�an K�lqvist <kjellqvist@nordkalak.se>

  * Added swedish translation


2001-11-17 Thomas Nielsen <thomanie@stud.ntnu.no>

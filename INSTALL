Building and installing KFLog under X11 and Qt5 for Linux/Unix

===============================================================================

These are the instructions to build and install KFLog from source code under
Linux/Unix. The basic assumption is, that you will do it as normal user and
not as root!

Step 1)

You will need to set up a build environment for KFLog under X11. The
following components are mandatory:

  a) The g++ tools, GNUs C++ compiler
  b) The Qt tools qmake, moc and lrelease
  c) The Qt libraries libQtCore, libQtGui, libQtNetwork, libQtXml
  d) The Qt header files
  e) A git client and the tool unzip
  f) The tools dh_make and dpkg-buildpackage
  
At least the last Qt Release 5.15.2 should be used.

The different Linux distributions do provide normally installable packages for
that. For XUbuntu 22.04 you have to execute the following command to get them:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential git unzip
  sudo apt-get install qtcreator qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qt5-doc
  sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev bluez
  sudo apt-get install dh-make fakeroot dpkg-dev

Step 2)

Download the sources of KFLog as git repository.

  git clone https://github.com/kflog-project/KFLog.git

Step 3)

The simplest way to compile the source code under Ubuntu or Debian is:

  1. 'cd' into the root directory containing the source code and type
     'make -f Makefile.qmake all'

  2. Type 'make -f Makefile.qmake install_test' to install the application and
     data files. The program can be found in the subdirectory release/bin.
     It carry the name kflog. All data files are stored in your home
     directory and can be accessed by typing 'cd ~/KFLog/'. The map files are
     stored in different subdirectories under the subdirectory mapdata.
     Landscape, airfield and airspace data files are downloaded automatically,
     if you run kflog.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing 'make -f Makefile.qmake distclean'.

=====================
Current state at 2023
=====================

- KFLog is ported fully to Qt5.15.2 without using any old support library parts.
  Not all parts are tested in detail. Some parts can be unstable.

Known bugs
==========

- if the font size in KDE is too large, the numbers in the status
  bar are truncated (e.g. the speed). Maybe we can give those boxes
  a variable size?
  
- Map print support is missing, not yet ported to Qt5.

not really bugs
===============

- Configure needs to check for OpenGL and if it's not available, we
  either need to complain or we need to disable the GL-3D-view.

- Show engine noise in evaluation window


Things that disappeared while we got rid of KDE
===============================================

- tip of the day

- option to change waypoint when a waypoint with the same name as an
  existing waypoint is created. Right now we only offer "overwrite"
  and "cancel", not "change name".

- Cumulus flight recorder plugin -- this thing wouldn't work with
  the current Cumulus versions anyhow.
